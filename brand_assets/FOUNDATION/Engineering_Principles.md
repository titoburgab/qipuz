> *We build systems that are reliable, explainable, scalable, secure, and maintainable. These are not aspirations — they are requirements.*

## Foundational Stance

QIPUZ is an engineering company. Every product we build, every system we deliver, every integration we design reflects our technical judgment.

Engineering principles govern how we make decisions when there are trade-offs: between speed and reliability, between features and maintainability, between novelty and trust. These principles are the answer to the question: "What does QIPUZ believe good engineering looks like?"

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Reliability First

A system that sometimes works is not ready to ship.

We define reliability as: the system behaves as specified under realistic operating conditions, handles errors gracefully, and degrades predictably under failure conditions.

**Standards:**
- All production systems have defined error handling for known failure modes
- Critical paths have monitoring and alerting before they go live
- We do not ship systems without testing under realistic load conditions

---

### 2. Explainability as a Design Constraint

If a system cannot be explained to the people who operate it, it is not finished.

This principle is especially critical for AI systems, where behavior can be opaque by default. We design explainability in from the beginning — through clear logging, interpretable outputs, and documented decision logic — not as a retrofit.

**Standards:**
- AI system outputs include confidence indicators or uncertainty signals where applicable
- Every automated decision that affects users has a documented rationale pathway
- System logs are written to be read by humans, not just parsed by machines

---

### 3. Scalability by Architecture

We do not build systems that work for today's load and fail at tomorrow's.

Scalability is an architectural decision made before the first line of code. It means modular design, clear separation of concerns, and explicit documentation of the assumptions built into the system's current capacity.

**Standards:**
- Services are stateless where possible
- Data pipelines are designed to be reprocessed
- Architecture decisions that create scaling ceilings are documented in `FOUNDATION/Decision_Log.md`

---

### 4. Security by Default

Security is not a feature. It is a constraint that applies to every component.

We do not add security after the fact. We design systems with the principle of least privilege, and we treat every external input as potentially adversarial until proven otherwise.

**Standards:**
- Authentication and authorization are designed before feature development begins
- No secrets in source code — environment configuration only
- AI systems have defined input validation and output sanitization

---

### 5. Maintainability as Respect

Code is read more often than it is written. Every line we write is a communication to the next engineer.

We write code that can be understood, modified, and extended by a thoughtful senior engineer who did not build it — because that engineer is often us, six months later.

**Standards:**
- Every repository has a current README
- Non-obvious architectural decisions have inline documentation
- Naming conventions follow the project's defined style guide

---

### 6. Documentation is Part of the Deliverable

A system without documentation is incomplete.

Documentation includes: how to run it, how to configure it, how it handles failure, what it does not do, and why significant architectural choices were made.

**Standards:**
- No system ships without a README
- API contracts are documented before implementation begins
- Decisions with lasting architectural impact are recorded in `Decision_Log.md`

---

## Engineering Decision Framework

When facing an engineering trade-off, apply this order of priority:

1. **Correctness** — Does it work as specified?
2. **Reliability** — Does it work consistently under realistic conditions?
3. **Maintainability** — Can the next engineer understand it?
4. **Performance** — Is it fast enough for the use case?
5. **Elegance** — Is it as clean as it could be?

Performance and elegance matter. Correctness and reliability matter more.

## Technology Stance

QIPUZ does not have a permanent technology stack. We select tools based on the requirements of each engagement.

However, we hold these positions:

- **Use boring technology where it works.** The most reliable systems are often built on proven, well-understood tools. Novelty is not a virtue in infrastructure.
- **Prefer composable systems.** Monolithic systems that cannot be decomposed create risk. Design for separation of concerns from the start.
- **Own your data layer.** Data architecture decisions are the most expensive to reverse. Think carefully before locking into platform-specific data structures.
- **AI is a component, not an architecture.** AI capabilities should be integrated as services with clear interfaces, not woven through the entire system.

---

## AI Integration Principles

When integrating AI capabilities into a system:

1. Define the AI's scope precisely — what it decides, what it recommends, what it escalates
2. Design the human oversight interface before designing the AI behavior
3. Create evaluation benchmarks before deploying the system
4. Monitor model behavior in production and set thresholds for human review
5. Document every prompt, model version, and parameter that affects system behavior

See `AI/Agent_Framework.md` and `AI/Governance.md` for detailed standards.

## Naming Conventions

### Files and Directories
- Use `PascalCase` for document names: `Engineering_Principles.md`
- Use `snake_case` for code files and assets: `color_tokens.json`
- Use `kebab-case` for URL paths and web assets: `ai-agent-framework`

### Code
- Variables and functions: `camelCase`
- Classes and components: `PascalCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Database tables: `snake_case`

### Commits
Follow Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`
