## Our Stance on AI

QIPUZ is an AI engineering company. We build AI systems for a living. This means our relationship with AI is practical, not ideological — we work with its actual capabilities and limitations, not the capabilities it is claimed to have in marketing materials.

These principles define how we think about AI: what it is for, how it should be built, what it should not do, and how it must be governed.

## What AI Should Do

**Automate repetitive, rule-based work.**
AI is most reliable — and most valuable — when it is applied to work that has clear inputs, clear outputs, and well-defined success criteria. Data extraction, classification, routing, summarization, format conversion: these are excellent targets for AI automation.

**Augment human decision-making.**
AI excels at processing large volumes of information and surfacing what is relevant. Humans excel at applying judgment in ambiguous situations. Good AI systems combine both: they handle the information processing and present synthesized, relevant data to the human who needs to decide.

**Accelerate knowledge work.**
AI can help people do faster what they already know how to do well. Code completion, document drafting, research synthesis, meeting summarization: these are legitimate applications that reduce friction without replacing judgment.

**Make organizational knowledge accessible.**
Most organizations have significant knowledge locked in documents, email threads, and people's heads. AI can make that knowledge searchable, connectable, and usable at the moment it is needed.

## What AI Should Not Do

**Make high-stakes decisions without human oversight.**
Employment, medical, legal, financial, and safety decisions require human accountability. AI may inform these decisions. It should not make them autonomously.

**Operate without defined boundaries.**
Every AI system we build has explicit documentation of what it is authorized to do, what it escalates to humans, and what it is not permitted to do under any circumstances.

**Optimize for engagement at the expense of accuracy.**
AI systems that are rewarded for engagement, not accuracy, will optimize for engagement. We build systems rewarded for the right outcomes.

**Hide uncertainty.**
A system that is uncertain should say so. Confident-sounding AI outputs in situations of genuine uncertainty erode trust faster than any admission of limitation.

## Core AI Principles

### 1. Explainability
Where possible, AI systems should be able to explain why they produced a given output. For classification, this means surfacing the features that drove the decision. For generation, this means clear attribution and reasoning. Opacity is acceptable only when explainability is technically infeasible, and must be documented as a known limitation.

### 2. Appropriate Autonomy
Every AI agent has a defined scope of authority. Actions within that scope may be taken autonomously. Actions outside that scope require human approval. This scope is documented, version-controlled, and reviewed regularly.

### 3. Human Oversight
We design human oversight interfaces before we design AI behavior. The ability for a human to review, correct, override, and audit an AI system is not optional — it is a requirement.

### 4. Honest Uncertainty
AI systems should communicate uncertainty explicitly. Probability scores, confidence indicators, and explicit flagging of ambiguous cases are required where the system's confidence affects decision quality.

### 5. Data Integrity
AI systems are only as good as the data they operate on. We audit data quality, document data provenance, and flag when a model is operating outside its training distribution.

### 6. Privacy by Default
AI systems handle data with the minimum permissions necessary. Personal data is not retained beyond the scope of the specific task. Data handling is documented and disclosed to clients.

### 7. Continuous Evaluation
Deployed AI systems are monitored for performance drift, data drift, and behavioral changes. Evaluation benchmarks are defined before deployment and reviewed on a defined schedule after.

## AI Safety Stance

We take AI safety seriously as a practical engineering concern, not as an abstract philosophical position.

For the AI systems QIPUZ builds:

- We define failure modes before deployment and design for graceful degradation
- We implement rate limiting and scope constraints on all autonomous agents
- We maintain human-in-the-loop oversight on any action that cannot be reversed
- We do not deploy AI systems in high-stakes domains without explicit client governance agreements
- We document and disclose known limitations of every system we deliver

## Governance Requirements

All QIPUZ AI deployments must have:

1. A defined scope document: what the system does and does not do
2. A human oversight interface or process
3. An evaluation framework with defined benchmarks
4. A monitoring plan with defined review intervals
5. A documented off-ramp: how to pause or disable the system if problems arise

See `AI/Governance.md` for the full governance framework.
