## What an Agent Is

An AI agent is a system that perceives inputs, reasons about them, and takes actions — repeatedly, across multiple steps — to achieve a defined goal.

The word "agent" is overloaded in the current AI market. At QIPUZ, an agent is characterized by three properties:

1. **Multi-step execution** — The system can plan and execute sequences of actions, not just single-step completions
2. **Tool use** — The system can interact with external systems: databases, APIs, files, communication platforms
3. **Defined scope** — The system operates within explicit boundaries; actions outside those boundaries trigger escalation or abort

An agent is not a chatbot with tool access. It is an engineered system with defined behavior, measurable performance, and governance controls.

## Agent Architecture Pattern

Every QIPUZ agent follows this architectural pattern:

```
INPUT LAYER
├── Input validation and sanitization
├── Context assembly (memory, documents, state)
└── Authorization check (is this request within scope?)

REASONING LAYER
├── Planning (what steps are needed?)
├── Tool selection (which tools serve each step?)
└── Confidence assessment (is the agent confident enough to act?)

EXECUTION LAYER
├── Tool calls (ordered, logged, with timeout and retry logic)
├── Output validation (does the result match expectations?)
└── Error handling (fallback, retry, or escalate)

OVERSIGHT LAYER
├── Human review interface (for low-confidence or high-stakes actions)
├── Audit log (every action recorded with timestamp and rationale)
└── Abort mechanism (clean shutdown on scope violation or error threshold)

OUTPUT LAYER
├── Structured output (defined schema)
├── Confidence indicator
└── Audit reference (link to the log entry for this execution)
```

---

## Scope Definition

Every agent deployment begins with a Scope Document. This is not optional.

The Scope Document defines:

**Authorized actions** — What the agent is permitted to do without human approval.

**Escalation triggers** — What conditions require human review before proceeding:
- Confidence below threshold
- Action cost above threshold (cost in dollars, data written, communications sent)
- Novel situation with no clear match to training cases
- Action is irreversible

**Prohibited actions** — What the agent must never do under any circumstances, regardless of instruction.

**Abort conditions** — What causes the agent to stop execution entirely:
- Repeated failures above threshold
- Scope violation detected
- Human abort signal received

## Memory Architecture

| Memory Type | Duration | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Conversation context | Single session | Current task state, user instructions |
| Working memory | Single execution | Intermediate results within a multi-step task |
| Session memory | Duration of engagement | Client preferences, established context |
| Long-term memory | Persistent | Organizational knowledge, historical outcomes |
| Semantic memory | Persistent | Vector-indexed document and knowledge base |

All persistent memory requires explicit client authorization and data governance agreement.

## Tool Design Standards

Tools built for QIPUZ agents follow these standards:

1. **Single responsibility** — Each tool does one thing. Composite operations use tool sequences, not composite tools.
2. **Explicit error returns** — Tools return structured errors, never silent failures.
3. **Idempotency** — Where possible, tools are idempotent: calling them twice with the same inputs produces the same result.
4. **Timeout handling** — Every tool call has a defined timeout. Long-running tools are asynchronous with status polling.
5. **Cost transparency** — If a tool call has a financial or data cost, it is estimated before execution and confirmed.

---

## Evaluation Framework

Before any agent is deployed, it is evaluated against:

**Accuracy benchmark** — Does the agent complete its intended task at an acceptable rate?

**Boundary benchmark** — Does the agent correctly recognize and escalate out-of-scope situations?

**Adversarial benchmark** — Does the agent respond correctly to edge cases, ambiguous inputs, and attempted manipulation?

**Performance benchmark** — Does the agent complete tasks within acceptable time and cost parameters?

**Failure benchmark** — Does the agent fail gracefully? Are failures logged, escalated, and recoverable?

Benchmarks are defined before the agent is built and used as acceptance criteria for deployment.

## Prompt Architecture

See `AI/Prompt_Architecture.md` for detailed prompt engineering standards.

Key principles:
- System prompts define the agent's identity, scope, and constraints
- Task prompts define the specific objective for the current execution
- Context assembly is deterministic and version-controlled
- Prompts are treated as code: versioned, tested, and reviewed
