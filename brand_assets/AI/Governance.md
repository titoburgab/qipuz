# AI Governance

## AI / Governance.md

> *Trust in AI is earned through governance. This document defines the frameworks, standards, and processes that govern every AI system QIPUZ builds and deploys.*

## Why Governance Exists

An AI system without governance is a liability.

Not because AI is inherently dangerous, but because any powerful system deployed without clear accountability, defined scope, and human oversight will eventually behave in ways its operators did not intend, cannot explain, and may not detect.

QIPUZ governance exists to ensure that every system we build:
- Does what it is supposed to do
- Does not do what it is not supposed to do
- Can be understood, audited, and corrected
- Operates within defined ethical and operational boundaries

## Governance Framework

### Pre-Deployment Requirements

Before any AI system is deployed in production, the following must be documented and approved:

#### 1. Scope Document
- What the system is authorized to do
- What the system is explicitly prohibited from doing
- What conditions trigger escalation to human review
- What conditions trigger automatic system pause

#### 2. Evaluation Benchmark
- Defined test suite covering the system's intended behavior
- Defined failure cases and acceptable failure rates
- Baseline performance metrics established before deployment

#### 3. Human Oversight Interface
- Defined process for human review of system outputs
- Clear escalation path for edge cases and ambiguous situations
- Access controls: who can review, approve, modify, or pause the system

#### 4. Monitoring Plan
- Metrics tracked in production
- Alert thresholds for performance degradation
- Review cadence: minimum quarterly for production systems

#### 5. Off-Ramp Procedure
- How to pause the system without data loss
- How to roll back to a previous system state
- Notification procedure for stakeholders if the system is paused

### Deployment Authorization

| System Type | Authorization Required |
|---|---|
| Internal tooling, low stakes | Project lead |
| Client-facing, low stakes | Project lead + Technical lead |
| Client-facing, high stakes | Project lead + Technical lead + QIPUZ principal |
| Autonomous action with irreversible effects | Full governance review + client sign-off |

**High-stakes** is defined as: any system whose outputs directly affect employment, compensation, legal status, medical decisions, financial transactions, or public-facing communications.

---

### Production Monitoring Standards

All deployed systems are monitored for:

**Performance drift** — When model outputs deviate from baseline benchmarks by more than 10%, a review is triggered.

**Data drift** — When input data distributions deviate significantly from training distributions, the system is flagged for re-evaluation.

**Error rate escalation** — When escalation-to-human rates exceed the defined threshold, a review is triggered within 72 hours.

**Adversarial inputs** — All inputs are logged. Patterns suggesting adversarial probing are flagged for security review.

### Incident Response

#### Severity Levels

| Level | Definition | Response Time | Escalation |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | System causing measurable harm | Immediate | Pause system + notify client within 1 hour |
| P2 | System producing significantly incorrect outputs | 4 hours | Review and correct within 24 hours |
| P3 | System underperforming vs. benchmarks | 72 hours | Review and document within 1 week |
| P4 | Minor behavioral anomaly | Next review cycle | Document and monitor |

## Ethical Principles in Practice

### Data Privacy
- Personal data is processed with minimum necessary permissions
- Data is not retained beyond the scope of the specific task without explicit client agreement
- Data handling practices are documented and disclosed to clients before engagement

### Bias and Fairness
- Systems that make decisions affecting individuals are evaluated for demographic bias before deployment
- Evaluation datasets include diverse examples representative of the deployment population
- Known bias limitations are documented and disclosed

### Transparency
- Clients receive documentation of what the AI system does and how it makes decisions
- Uncertainty and confidence levels are surfaced to end users where technically feasible
- QIPUZ does not represent AI outputs as human-generated

### Human Oversight
- No autonomous AI action is irreversible without human confirmation
- Every production system has a defined human oversight process
- The right to override, pause, or modify an AI system always belongs to the client

---

## Client Governance Agreements

For all client AI deployments, QIPUZ requires:

1. **Signed AI Governance Agreement** — defining roles, responsibilities, and escalation procedures
2. **Designated client AI owner** — a named individual responsible for oversight on the client side
3. **Quarterly review cadence** — minimum for production systems
4. **Incident notification procedure** — agreed response protocol for P1 and P2 incidents

---

## QIPUZ's Own AI Use

QIPUZ uses AI internally for: code assistance, documentation drafting, research synthesis, and design iteration.

All internal AI use is subject to the same principles that govern client systems:
- No confidential client data is processed in external AI systems without client consent
- AI-generated content is reviewed by a human before it is used in client-facing contexts
- Internal AI tools are documented and their use is logged
